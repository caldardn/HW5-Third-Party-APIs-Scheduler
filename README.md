# HW5-Third-Party-APIs-Scheduler

## Description
This challenge was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am–5pm). This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The application follows the following user’s acceptance criteria:

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN I open the planner

THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

WHEN I scroll down

THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm

WHEN I view the time blocks for that day

THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, 
present, or future

WHEN I click into a time block

THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that time block

THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page

THEN the saved events persist
